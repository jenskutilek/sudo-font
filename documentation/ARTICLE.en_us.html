    Sudo is a font designed for terminals, programming, and user interfaces. Use at 13 pixels size for optimal results.
    It has a monospaced variant, simply called <em>Sudo</em>, and a proportional variant, called </em>Sudo UI</em>. A
    Variable Font version is available. It has an extra variation axis to modify the length of descenders.
