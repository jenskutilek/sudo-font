# The Sudo font family

<img src="https://raw.github.com/jenskutilek/sudo-font/master/images/sudo-monospaced-ui-font.png">

Sudo is a font designed for terminals, programming, and user interfaces. Use at 16 pixels size for optimal results. It has a monospaced variant, simply called _Sudo,_ and a proportional variant, called _Sudo UI._ A Variable Font version is available. It has an extra variation axis to modify the length of descenders.

Sudo decidedly has no ligatures, but supports all common [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) glyphs out of the box.
