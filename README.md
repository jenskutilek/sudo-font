Sudo is a font designed for terminals, programming, and user interfaces. Use at 16 pixels size for optimal results. It has a monospaced variant, simply called _Sudo,_ and a proportional variant, called _Sudo UI._ A Variable Font version is available. It has an extra variation axis to modify the length of descenders.

Sudo decidedly has no ligatures, but supports all common [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) glyphs out of the box.

Find out more about the fonts at https://www.kutilek.de/sudo-font/ or download the [latest release](https://github.com/jenskutilek/sudo-font/releases/latest/download/sudo.zip).

## About

Sudo was designed by [Jens Kut√≠lek](https://www.kutilek.de/), a graphic and type designer and font engineer based in Berlin.


## Installation


### Arch Linux

Sudo is available in the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) as [ttf-sudo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-sudo).


### Debian and Ubuntu Linux

You can use my private apt repository to install and update the fonts.

See the [Debian README](README-Debian.md) for details.

### FreeBSD

Sudo is available in the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

```sh
pkg install sudo-font
```

### macOS

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jenskutilek/sudo-font/releases/latest/download/sudo.zip) and copy the TTF files into `/Library/Fonts` or `~/Library/Fonts`.

Sudo is also available as a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package.

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-sudo
```


## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://jenskutilek.github.io/sudo-font.git.
